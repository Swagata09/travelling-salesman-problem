# travelling-salesman-problem (TSP)

This repository will explain Travelling Salesman problem where one has to visit multiple cities of country with shortest possible path

## Problem Statement

To calculate shortest path that will cover all the 256 cities of USA so that 2020 US Presidential Candidate can visit all these cities for his/her campaign starting from San Fransisco and this tour ends in the same city. Each city should visit only once and starting & ending city should be same.We have to calculate shortest distance possible for this campaign.
